This repository demonstrates a subtle error in a shell script related to command substitution and variable assignment. The script intends to search for errors within a file using `grep`.  The issue lies in how the output of the `grep` command is handled and assigned to a variable.  The solution shows the correct way to perform the check and properly handle cases where no errors are found.
